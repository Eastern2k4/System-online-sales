# 🚀 E-Commerce Frontend Development Project

## Overview

This project follows a **frontend-first development approach**. We're focusing on creating an excellent user experience and beautiful design before implementing backend functionality.

## 🎯 Current Phase: Figma Design & Frontend Development

### What We're Doing Now

1. **Figma Design**: Creating wireframes, mockups, and prototypes
2. **Component Library**: Designing reusable UI components
3. **User Flow Mapping**: Planning the complete user journey
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring mobile-first approach

### What's NOT Implemented Yet

- Database integration
- User authentication
- Payment processing
- Order management
- Product catalog backend
- API endpoints for business logic

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend (Current Focus)

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with Grid/Flexbox
- **JavaScript** - Vanilla JS for now, may upgrade to React/Vue later
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach

### Backend (Future Implementation)

- **Spring Boot** - Java backend framework
- **MySQL** - Database (when ready)
- **RESTful APIs** - For frontend-backend communication
